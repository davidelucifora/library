# MyLibrary
MyLibrary is a webApp using Javascript to keep track of books owned.
It's one of the assignments of The Odin Project full stack curriculum.
The point of the assignment is to learn how to use objects, constructors, prototypes and their methods. 

### Live Demo [Here](http://dalux21.github.io/library)

## Requirements
1. Display the books in the library.
2. Allow users to Add a new book with Author, Title and whether it's read or not. 
3. Allow users to toggle the read status. The requirement is to have the toggle status function as a method of the book constructor prototype.
4. Allow users to remove the books from the library.
5. (Optional) Add persistency with localStorage: Done.
6. (Optional) Add sign in and persistency with Realtime database on Firebase (In Progress).

## What I've learned

1. How Object/Constructor/Prototype inheritance and instantiation work. 
2. How to better design and optimize apps using methods on object prototypes.
3. How to store and retrieve data to/from local storage.
